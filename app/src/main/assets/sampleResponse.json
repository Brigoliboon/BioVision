            "best_light_condition": "This plant thrives in full sun, needing at least six hours of direct sunlight each day. It can tolerate partial shade, but too little light can result in fewer blooms and leggy growth. If you're growing it indoors, place it near a south-facing window where it can get plenty of light. In areas with very hot summers, some afternoon shade can help prevent the leaves from scorching.",
            "best_soil_type": "For optimal growth, this plant prefers well-draining soil. A mix that includes sand, loam, and organic matter works well. Good drainage is essential to prevent water from pooling around the roots, which can cause rot. If you're planting in a container, make sure it has drainage holes and use a high-quality potting mix designed for flowering plants.",
            "common_uses": "This plant is commonly used as an ornamental in gardens, borders, and containers. Its vibrant flowers make it a popular choice for adding color to outdoor spaces. It's also used in hanging baskets and window boxes. Some people grow it indoors as a houseplant, especially in areas where outdoor gardening is limited by climate. Its versatility and ease of care make it a popular choice for both novice and experienced gardeners.",
            "cultural_significance": "In various cultures, this plant is often associated with cheerfulness and positivity due to its bright, daisy-like flowers. It's commonly used in gardens and landscapes to add a splash of color. In some regions, it's also used in traditional floral arrangements and ceremonies. Its long blooming season makes it a favorite for both public and private gardens.",
            "toxicity": "This plant is generally considered non-toxic to both humans and animals. However, it's always a good idea to discourage pets and children from chewing on any plant material. While it doesn't pose a significant risk, ingesting large amounts of any plant can cause digestive upset. If you have concerns, consult with a veterinarian or a medical professional.",
            "best_watering": "Watering this plant properly is crucial for its health. It prefers consistently moist soil but doesn't like to sit in water. Overwatering can lead to root rot, so it's important to let the top inch of soil dry out between waterings. During the hotter months, you might need to water more frequently, while in cooler weather, less frequent watering is usually sufficient. Always check the soil moisture before watering to avoid any issues.",

              "value": "Anthemis cotula, also known as stinking chamomile, or mayweed, is a flowering annual plant with a noticeable and strong odor. The odor is often considered unpleasant, and it is from this that it gains the common epithet \"stinking\". In pre-colonial times, its distribution was limited to the Old Continent and Africa; though it was established in most of Europe, it was not present in Finland, Ireland, or the northernmost reaches of Scotland, in spite of the fact that these countries feature climatic regions favorable to this plant and are in proximity to countries where the species is native, such as Russia, Estonia, Lithuania and England. It has successfully migrated to the New Europes where it can be found growing in meadows, alongside roads, and in fields.The name \"cotula\" is the Latin form of κοτύλη kotylē,  the Greek word for \"small cup\", describing the shape of the flowers; it was assigned by Carl Linnaeus in his work Species Plantarum in 1753.Anthemis cotula is also known by a wide variety of other names, including mather, dog- or hog's-fennel, dog-finkle, dog-daisy, pig-sty-daisy, chigger-weed, mayweed, Johnnyweed, maroute, Maruta cotula, Cotula Maruta foetida, Manzanilla loca, wild chamomile, Camomille puante. Foetid Chamomile, maithes, maithen, mathor mayweed chamomile, camomille des chiens, camomille puante, stinkende Hundskamille, camomila-de-cachorro, macéla-fétida, and manzanilla hedionda.",

              "value": "Senecio glastifolius is a species of flowering plant in the aster family known by the common names woad-leaved ragwort, holly-leaved senecio, and pink ragwort. A tall perennial herb, it is native to southern Africa, and it is cultivated as an ornamental plant for its colorful flowers. It has been known to escape cultivation and become naturalized in areas of appropriate climate; it can be found growing wild in parts of New Zealand and Australia.It favours a Mediterranean climate, often coastal, typically colonizing disturbed soil. It is an annual herb producing a single, erect, branching stem which grows to a height 1 to 1.5 metres tall. The serrated leaves are often more coarsely toothed near the leaf base, and feel prickly. The inflorescence bears flower heads lined with black-tipped bracts. They contain a yellowish disc at the centre, with mauve petals.  \n\nSenecio glastifolius is sometimes confused with Senecio elegans, (which also grows by the coast), but the leaves of the two species are different.",

Its attractive flowers make it a popular choice for garden borders, rock gardens, and containers. In some traditional practices, it is used to treat various ailments, although scientific evidence supporting these uses is limited.

Overwatering can lead to root rot, so it's important to let the top inch of soil dry out between waterings. During the growing season, water it more frequently, but reduce the amount in the winter when the plant is not actively growing. Using a well-draining pot or soil mix can help prevent water from accumulating at the roots.",
