            "best_light_condition": "This plant thrives in full sun, needing at least six hours of direct sunlight each day. It can tolerate partial shade, but too much shade can result in fewer blooms and leggy growth. If you're growing it indoors, place it near a south-facing window where it can get plenty of light. In areas with extremely hot climates, some afternoon shade can help protect it from scorching.",
            "best_soil_type": "For optimal growth, this plant prefers well-draining soil. Sandy or loamy soils are ideal, as they prevent water from pooling around the roots. It can tolerate poor soil conditions but will perform best in soil that is rich in organic matter. Adding compost or aged manure to the planting area can improve soil fertility and structure, promoting healthier growth and more vibrant blooms.",
            "common_uses": "Commonly, this plant is used for ornamental purposes in gardens and landscapes. Its vibrant flowers make it a popular choice for borders, flower beds, and containers. It also attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies, making it beneficial for the ecosystem. Additionally, the flowers can be cut and used in floral arrangements, adding a splash of color to indoor spaces. Some people also use it in companion planting to repel pests and improve the growth of neighboring plants.",
            "cultural_significance": "This plant holds cultural significance in various parts of the world. In Mexico, it is often associated with the Day of the Dead celebrations, where it is used to decorate altars and graves. Its bright, cheerful flowers symbolize peace and love, making it a popular choice for gardens and floral arrangements. In some cultures, it is also seen as a symbol of order and harmony due to its symmetrical, daisy-like blooms.",
            "toxicity": "This plant is generally considered non-toxic to both humans and animals. It doesn't contain any harmful chemicals that would pose a risk if ingested. However, it's always a good idea to supervise pets and children around plants to prevent any accidental ingestion. While it's safe, it's not particularly palatable, so it's unlikely to be eaten in large quantities.",
            "best_watering": "Watering this plant properly is crucial for its health. It prefers consistent moisture but doesn't like to sit in waterlogged soil. Water it thoroughly when the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch. During hot, dry periods, you might need to water it more frequently. However, be careful not to overwater, as this can lead to root rot. Mulching around the base can help retain soil moisture and reduce the need for frequent watering.",
